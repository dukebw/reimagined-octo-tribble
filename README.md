# reimagined-octo-tribble machine learning library


## Project goals

1. Run as fast as possible in terms of both optimizing computation speed and
   minimizing library baggage.

2. Provide a granular C API that can allow control over the training/inference
   loop at both high and low abstraction levels.

3. Support both AMD and NVIDIA GPUs, as well as CPU.
